## Standard gems

See https://stdgems.org.

> Default gems: These gems are part of Ruby and you can always require them
> directly. You cannot remove them. They are maintained by Ruby core.
> 
> Bundled gems: The behavior of bundled gems is similar to normal gems, but
> they get automatically installed when you install Ruby. They can be
> uninstalled and they are maintained outside of Ruby core.

We aren't sure how installing standard gems from RubyGems will work with
TruffleRuby in the future, as our versions sometimes differ from the
originals. At the moment, we're just storing sources in our repository and
shipping the full set as MRI does, and we'll tackle issue when they come in
future versions of Ruby.

Keep these versions in sync with `versions.json`.
